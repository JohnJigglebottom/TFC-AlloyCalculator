# TFC-AlloyCalculator
This HTML document is a simple alloy calculator for TFC (TerraFirmaCraft) mod in Minecraft. 
It contains two sections, an Ore to Alloy section for experimentation and testing of Ore/Metal/Alloy combinations and amounts, and an Alloy to Ore section, which gives you the volume and exact measurements of each of the Ores/Metals/Alloys that the Alloy requires.
It also gives you a chart visualization of the alloy containing its Ore/Metal/Alloy content.
I am open for suggestions, feel free to publish a suggestion in the respective HardRock HTFC3-Tips forum or Reddit where I have posted the github link or the calculator in.
