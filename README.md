# TFC-AlloyCalculator

A lightweight, HTML-based alloy calculator for modded **TerraFirmaCraft (TFC)** Minecraft. Specifically ones that use **TFC Ore Washing** (e.g., HTFC3). This tool is designed to help players efficiently test, plan, and visualize alloy combinations, whether for experimentation or practical gameplay use.

## Features

### Main Tools
- **Ore to Alloy**  
  Experiment with different combinations and quantities of ores, metals, and alloys to see the resulting output.

- **Alloy to Ore**  
  Input a target alloy and get the required volume and exact breakdown of components needed.

### Additional Tools
- **Visual Chart**  
  Displays a graphical representation of an alloy's composition by ore/metal content.

- **Alloy Planner**  
  Automatically completes the rest of the required components once a valid starting entry is provided.

- **Alloy Ratio Slider**  
  Dynamically adjust the volume of one or more components in accordance with the alloy’s percentage range.

## Beta Disclaimer

This project is currently in **Beta**. Expect bugs, issues, and possible compatibility issues—especially on mobile devices or certain browsers.  
For the best experience and performance, please use a **desktop browser**.

## Suggestions & Feedback

Suggestions, feedback, and bug reports are welcome!  
Feel free to share your input on:
- The **HardRock HTFC3-Tips forum**
- The relevant **Reddit thread** where this tool or GitHub repository has been shared

## Notes

- Always verify values in-game, as alloy data may vary depending on mod updates or documentation inconsistencies.
- Some alloys (e.g., **Bismuth Bronze**) have unusual percentage totals listed in the wiki (e.g., 115%). In such cases, use the default ratio (**50/50**) to avoid exceeding or falling short of the required total.
